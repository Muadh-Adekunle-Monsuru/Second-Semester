IC Fabrication Process Summary



**Summarize the  integrated circuit fabrication process**

The integrated circuit (IC) fabrication process involves multiple steps to create a functioning electronic circuit on a tiny chip. The general steps include:

**Design**: A computer-aided design (CAD) tool is used to create a plan for the circuit.

**Photolithography**: The circuit design is transferred onto a silicon wafer using light-sensitive photoresist and a mask.

**Etching**: The wafer is etched to remove unwanted material and shape the circuit patterns.

**Deposition**: Thin layers of conducting and insulating materials are deposited onto the wafer to create the transistors, capacitors, and other components of the circuit.

**Doping**: Impurities are introduced into the silicon to create p-type and n-type semiconductors.

**Metalization**: Conductive metal wires are deposited onto the wafer to connect the components.

**Packaging**: The wafer is cut into individual chips and packaged in a protective material.

**Testing**: The chips are tested to ensure that they function as intended.

The entire process is done in a clean room environment to prevent contamination and ensure high yield.
