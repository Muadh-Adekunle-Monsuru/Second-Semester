1. Read on Cloud & Paper storage
2. What are the major motivations behind cloud or online storage. Look for the various cloud solutions

	Cloud storage is a service that allows users to store and access data on remote servers over the internet. 
	The major motivations behind cloud storage are:
	- scalability, 
	- reliability, 
	- security 
	- cost-efficiency. 
	Cloud storage can be classified into various types based on the service model, such as
	- cloud object storage, 
	- cloud file storage 
	- cloud block storage. 

- Object storage is used for storing large amounts of unstructured data such as images, videos, and audio files. It stores data as objects in a flat address space and can be accessed through APIs.

- Block storage is used for storing data that requires high performance and low latency such as databases and virtual machines. It stores data as blocks that can be accessed through block-level protocols such as iSCSI.

- File storage is used for storing files that require shared access such as documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. It stores data as files in a hierarchical directory structure and can be accessed through file-level protocols such as NFS.
