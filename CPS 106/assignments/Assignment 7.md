What are database models?

Database models are ways of organizing and manipulating data in a database. Different database models have different structures, operations, and methods to store, access, and relate data. Some of the most common database models are:

- Relational model: This model uses tables of data that are grouped and normalized based on their characteristics. Each table has columns (attributes) and rows (records) that can be linked by keys. Relational databases are easy to use, flexible, scalable, precise, and secure.

- Hierarchical model: This model uses a tree-like structure of data that has a single root node and multiple child nodes. Each node can have only one parent node, but can have many child nodes. Hierarchical databases are easy to add and delete data, relate to natural hierarchies, and support one-to-many relationships.

- Network model: This model uses a graph-like structure of data that has multiple nodes and links. Each node can have multiple parent and child nodes, and each link can have multiple records. Network databases support many-to-many relationships and allow faster searches.

- Object-oriented model: This model uses objects of data that have attributes (properties) and methods (functions). Each object can belong to a class (type) that defines its behavior and inheritance. Object-oriented databases support complex data types, encapsulation, polymorphism, and reusability.

- Document model: This model uses documents of data that are stored in a semi-structured or unstructured format. Each document can have different fields (attributes) and values (data). Document databases are flexible, scalable, schema-less, and support nested data.

2. Advantages and disadvanatages of DBMS
A database management system (DBMS) is a software that allows users to create, manipulate, and store data in an organized way. DBMS has many advantages and disadvantages that should be considered before choosing one for a specific application.

Some of the advantages of DBMS are:

- Data consistency: DBMS ensures that the data stored in the database is accurate and consistent across different applications and users.
- Data security: DBMS provides mechanisms to protect the data from unauthorized access, modification, or deletion.
- Data abstraction: DBMS hides the details of how the data is stored and managed from the users, allowing them to focus on the logic and functionality of their applications.
- Data independence
