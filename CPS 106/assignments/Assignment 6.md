1. What is turn-around time: In the statement "Batch processing increases the turn-around time"
2. Disadvantages of batch processing


"turn-around time" refers to the time it takes for a batch of jobs to be processed and completed. Turn around time in batch processing is high because the jobs must wait in line to be processed, and they may not be processed in the order in which they were submitted. Additionally, batch processing can require more resources than real-time processing, which can also contribute to longer turn-around times.

Here are some of the factors that can affect the turn-around time for batch processing:

* The number of jobs in the batch
* The size of the jobs
* The complexity of the jobs
* The availability of resources
* The efficiency of the batch processing system



2. Batch processing has a number of disadvantages, including:


* **It can be slow.** Batch processing can be slow because it requires the system to process all of the data in the batch before it can start processing the next batch. This can be a problem for applications that need to process data in real time.
* **It can be inflexible.** Batch processing is inflexible because it requires the data to be in a specific format before it can be processed. This can be a problem for applications that need to process data in a variety of formats.
* **It can be error-prone.** Batch processing can be error-prone because it requires the system to process a large amount of data. This can increase the risk of errors occurring.
* **It can be expensive.** Batch processing can be expensive because it requires the use of dedicated hardware and software. This can be a problem for small businesses or organizations with limited resources.
