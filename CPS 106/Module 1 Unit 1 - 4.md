### Introduction to Data Processing

**I am number 26**

The singular of data is **datum**

**Data refers to the basic facts about an object and it exists in a variety of forms**.
Such as numbers or text on a piece of paper. 
A data consists of numbers, words, images, audio, videos. 
A data is meaningless until it undergoes some forms of processing. 	
Object is a thing that has a state and a behaviour.


### Electronic Data Processing (EDP)
Any computer automated process that converts raw fact i,e data into an output i.e useful information.

Types of data processing systems:
- Manual data processing systems
- Electronic data processing systems

#### Electronic Data Processing Systems

The method of processing data electronically is called electronic data processing systems.

It is any computer **automated** process that converts raw facts i.e data into output i.e useful information. 

## Scope of data processing
Looking at the areas data processing covers:
- Algorithm deductions
- Data capture
- Data recording
- Data sorting
- Data verification
- Statistical reports

Basic operations of computer systems
- Input
- Processing
- Output
- Storage
- Communication

### Basic Software
Two categories of software
- System Software: Software that a computer system needs to for it to function. It includes the Operating System. It is used to manage the resources of the system, memory, files, processor and device.  System software provides the interface in which the user uses to communicate with the hardware
	- Operating System: Most important, it manages system resources, such as available memory space in the primary and secondary memory. It is a resource allocator and manager. 
	- Utility Software
	- Language Software
	 
- Application Software:  They leverage on the system software to work
	- Proprietary: One which is purchased
	- Custom-made:

### Data Capturing

They are also called input devices. All data captured are converted into bits.

Soft data entry device: scanners, ocr, omr, micr
	- OCR: Optical Character Recognition
	- OMR: Optical Mark Recognition
	- MICR: Magnetic Ink Character Recognition
