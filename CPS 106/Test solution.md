1. What is data processing: 
	 Data processing is the collection, manipulation and storage of data. It is the process of converting raw data into meaningful information. Data processing can be done manually or with computers. 
  2. What are data processing systems
	  These are computer systems that are designed to process data. 
3. Why must companies make use of data processing
	Data processing is used to gain meaningful insights into data from the organization, from customer data to staff data and financial data. It would be used to make informed decisions on matters critical to the company.  
4. Three functions of data processing systems in FUO
	1. Admission process, to filter out eligible applicants and collect their details
	2. Financial function: The school's bursary uses data processing to keep track of the financial standing of all the students throughout their length of stay at the university, it also allows the university to account for all the income they generate.
	3. Staff function: Keeps track of staff's payroll. 
5. Four applications of modern-day Data processing:
	1. Database software
	2. Presentation Software
	3. Word-processing Software
	4. Spreadsheet Software
6. Five essential steps for effective data processing:
1.  Data Collection: This activity involves gathering relevant data from various sources. It can include methods such as surveys, questionnaires, interviews, observation, or extracting data from existing databases and systems. The data collected should be relevant to the problem or analysis at hand.
    
2.  Data Validation and Cleaning: Once the data is collected, it needs to be validated and cleaned to ensure its accuracy and reliability. This involves checking for errors, inconsistencies, missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues. Invalid or inconsistent data points may be corrected or removed, and missing values may be imputed based on appropriate methods.
    
3.  Data Transformation and Integration: In this activity, the collected and cleaned data is transformed and integrated into a format suitable for analysis. It may involve standardizing units of measurement, normalizing data, aggregating data at different levels (e.g., monthly, quarterly), and combining data from multiple sources to create a unified dataset.
    
4.  Data Analysis: Once the data is transformed, it can be analyzed using various techniques and methods. Data analysis involves examining the data to identify patterns, relationships, trends, and insights. This can include descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, machine learning algorithms, or other analytical approaches depending on the goals of the analysis.
    
5.  Data Interpretation and Reporting: The final activity involves interpreting the results of the data analysis and presenting them in a meaningful way. This may include creating visualizations, charts, graphs, or summary statistics to communicate the findings effectively. The results should be interpreted in the context of the original problem or research question, and actionable insights or recommendations may be derived from the analysis.

1. What is File, Field, Record and Table and differentiate among the terms
2. Why is information system important to the development of an organization
3. What is time-sharing
4. What is aggregation in relation to data processing


1. What are digitizers
A digitizer is a device that converts analog signals into digital signals. It is used to input data into computers and other digital devices.raster and vector. Raster digitizers convert analog signals into a series of pixels, while vector digitizers convert analog signals into a series of points. Raster digitizers are more common than vector digitizers, as they are less expensive and easier to use.

7. What are computer Output Microfilms:  
Computer output microfilm (COM) is a technology that records computer output on microfilm. It is a way to store large amounts of data in a compact form. COM can be used to store any type of data, including text, images, and video.
