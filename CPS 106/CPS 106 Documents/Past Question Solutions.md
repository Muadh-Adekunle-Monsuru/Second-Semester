1. What is data processing: 
	 Data processing is the collection, manipulation and storage of data. It is the process of converting raw data into meaningful information. Data processing can be done manually or with computers. 
2. What are data processing systems
	  These are computer systems that are designed to process data. 
3. Why must companies make use of data processing
	Data processing is used to gain meaningful insights into data from the organization, from customer data to staff data and financial data. It would be used to make informed decisions on matters critical to the company.  
4. Three functions of data processing systems in FUO
	1. Admission process, to filter out eligible applicants and collect their details
	2. Financial function: The school's bursary uses data processing to keep track of the financial standing of all the students throughout their length of stay at the university, it also allows the university to account for all the income they generate.
	3. Staff function: Keeps track of staff's payroll. 
5. Four applications of modern-day Data processing:
	1. Database software
	2. Presentation Software
	3. Word-processing Software
	4. Spreadsheet Software
6. Five essential steps for effective data processing:
	1.  **Data Collection:** This activity involves gathering relevant data from various sources. It can include methods such as surveys, questionnaires, interviews, observation, or extracting data from existing databases and systems. 
	2.  **Data Validation and Cleaning:**  This involves checking for errors, inconsistencies, missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues. 
	3.  **Data Transformation and Integration:**  data is transformed and integrated into a format suitable for analysis. It may involve standardizing units of measurement, normalizing data, aggregating data at different levels (e.g., monthly, quarterly), and combining data from multiple sources to create a unified dataset.
	4.  **Data Analysis:**  it can be analyzed using various techniques and methods. Data analysis involves examining the data to identify patterns, relationships, trends, and insights. This can include descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, machine learning algorithms, or other analytical approaches depending on the goals of the analysis.
	5.  **Data Interpretation and Reporting:** The final activity involves interpreting the results of the data analysis and presenting them in a meaningful way. This may include creating visualizations, charts, graphs, or summary statistics to communicate the findings effectively. 
7. What is File, Field, Record and Table and differentiate among the terms
	-   **File:** A file is a collection of related records. For example, a file of employee records might contain records for all of the employees in a company.
	-   **Record:** A record is a collection of related fields. For example, an employee record might contain fields for the employee's name, address, and phone number.
	-   **Field:** A field is a single piece of data. For example, the field "name" in an employee record might contain the employee's first name and last name.
8. Why is information system important to the development of an organization
	An information system is a system that collects, stores, and processes data to provide information that can be used to make decisions. 
	- Improved efficiency
	- Improved customer service
	- Improved Decision making
	- Improved marketing
9. What is time-sharing
	Time-sharing is a method of data processing in which multiple users share a single computer system. Each user has their own terminal, and they can interact with the computer system at the same time. The computer system divides its time between the users, so that each user gets a small amount of time to use the computer system at a time. This allows multiple users to use the computer system simultaneously, even though the computer system only has one processor.
10. What is aggregation in relation to data processing
	Data aggregation is the process of combining data from multiple sources into a single, unified view. This can be done to improve the efficiency of data processing, to make it easier to analyze data, or to make it easier to share data with others.
11. Differentiate between Audit files and Backup Files
	Audit files are created when a user or system makes a change to data. They record the date, time, and user who made the change, as well as the old and new values of the data. Audit files can be used to track who made changes to data, when those changes were made, and what the changes were. This information can be used to investigate security incidents and to identify unauthorized access to data.
	Backup files are created as copies of data. They are used to restore data in the event of a data loss event, such as a hardware failure or a cyberattack. Backup files should be stored in a secure location and should be regularly tested to ensure that they can be restored successfully.
12. Differentiate between history files and transition files
	Transition files are created when data is migrated from one system to another. They contain the data that is being migrated, as well as information about the migration process. Transition files can be used to facilitate the migration of data by providing a way to track the progress of the migration and to identify any problems that may occur.
13. What is multiprogramming in data processing
	Multiprogramming is a technique in which multiple programs are loaded into the main memory of a computer and are executed concurrently. This means that multiple programs are running at the same time, but only one program is executing at any given moment. The operating system (OS) is responsible for switching between programs so that each program gets a turn to execute.
	
	Multiprogramming is a way to improve the utilization of the CPU. When a program is waiting for an I/O operation to complete, the CPU can be used to execute another program. This helps to prevent the CPU from being idle when a program is waiting for an I/O operation to complete.
14. What are digitizers
	A digitizer is a device that converts analog signals into digital signals. It is used to input data into computers and other digital devices raster and vector. Raster digitizers convert analog signals into a series of pixels, while vector digitizers convert analog signals into a series of points. Raster digitizers are more common than vector digitizers, as they are less expensive and easier to use.
15. What are computer Output Microfilms:  
	Computer output microfilm (COM) is a technology that records computer output on microfilm. It is a way to store large amounts of data in a compact form. COM can be used to store any type of data, including text, images, and video.
