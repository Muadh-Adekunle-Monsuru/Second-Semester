Data Communication
It involves exchanging of coded information between two different computers. 

A telecommunication system refers to a collection of compatible hardware and software required to exchange information from one location to another. 



#### Data Processing Techniques
- **Batch Processing:** Used to be the dominant form of data processing. Serial, sequential and offline are other names for it. Data is processed in batches. Data is gathered as a group collected and processed after the collection one at a time. It is at the end of the processing that a result/output can be accurately seen.

- **Online Processing**: Method whereby data about a single transaction is processed immediately it is captured.  The point of entry of the data may be remote from the location at which update is made. Transaction is entered directly into the system as they take place thereby updating the master file immediately as the transactions occur. The two systems can related directly with each other

- **Real-time:** The actual time between processing and result is very minimal, the interval between inquiry and response is very little. Not all online systems are real-time.

- Distributed: A distributed system allows the components of data processing system to be made available at multiple locations in a computer network. The computers, storage devices and other components may be distributed to separate locations throughout the organization for efficiency

Advantages of a distributed system:
- Modularity
- Better response time, data processing center is from a location close to the end user
- Ability to share data
- Greater reliability
- Lower cost

Disadvantages:
- Technical problem of connecting and maintaining dissimilar systems
- Sophisticated communication system which incurs additional cost
- Data integrity and security
- Requires skilled professional for system support
