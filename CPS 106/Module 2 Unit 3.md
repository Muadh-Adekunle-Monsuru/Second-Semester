#### Data Processing Techniques
- **Batch Processing:** Used to be the dominant form of data processing. Serial, sequential and offline are other names for it. Data is processed in batches. Data is gathered as a group collected and processed after the collection one at a time. It is at the end of the processing that a result/output can be accurately seen.

- **Online Processing**: Method whereby data about a single transaction is processed immediately it is captured.  The point of entry of the data may be remote from the location at which update is made. Transaction is entered directly into the system as they take place thereby updating the master file immediately as the transactions occur. The two systems can related directly with each other

- **Real-time:** The actual time between processing and result is very minimal, the interval between inquiry and response is very little. Not all online systems are real-time.
