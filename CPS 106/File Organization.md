File organization affect the order  at which file is being accessed. It is the way files are being organized. Files must be well maintained, managed and organized. File organization increases productivity and accessibility.

File Organization:
1. Serial File Organization: Records are not stored in a particular order. They are called serial file as they are saved on a serial storage medium. E.g Magnetic Tape. Data can only be accessed in sequence
2. Sequential File Organization: Records are stored in a particular order. They are called serial files (different to serial file organization) which are arranged in descending or ascending order and data has to be retrieved in same sequence. They can be used on magnetic tapes only because of the magnetic tape disadvantage. Sequential was introduced due to the disadvantages of serial file organization
3. Indexed Sequential: An improvement over sequential. It uses the sequential and direct access method. Index is like a block record of some of the keys that can be used to locate files. Users can manipulate what and how data is stored.
4. Direct or Random File Organization: Arranged in any order. Each location has its own address, so one can access a record by locating its address. It allows easy access and retrieval of information
