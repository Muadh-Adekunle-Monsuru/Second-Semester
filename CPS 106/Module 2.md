## Data Storage Devices:

**Memory Hierchy**
- Secondary Storage
- Primary Storage
- Registers
- Cache

**There are two basic storage technologies**
1. Magnetic Tape
2. Magnetic Disk: Hard Drive

**5 Storage Technologies**
1. Magnetic Storage Devices
2. Optical Storage Devices
3. Flash Storage Devices/NAND Flash Memory
4. Cloud/Online Storage Devices
5. Paper Storage

**Examples of Magnetic Storage Device**
1. Floppy Disk (diskette): This is a data storage medium that is composed of a disk of thin, flexible magnetic storage medium. It is read by a floppy drive and is mostly seen in desktop
2. Hard disk drive (HDD): Commonly reffered to as hard drive. It is a permanent storage device for large amount of data. 
		Hard-disk drive and hard disk are not the same thing. The hard disk is a set of stacked disks each of which can record data electromagnetically in concentric circles or tracks on the disk
3. Removable hard disk: Variation of hard disk that is easily removable. They provide large economical, fast and portable storage facility.
		 Two types of hard disksL
							1. Internal HHDs
							2. External/Removable HHD
4. Magnetic Tape: Data is stored on flexible nylon tape covered with magnetic oxide. Dataa on tapes are acessed sequencially. Cheaper and larger capacity disks caused the discline of magnetic tape
5. Floptical: Combination of floppy and optical

Factors to consider:
	1. Portability
	2. Durability
	3. Storage Capacity
	4. Access time
	5. Cost

Why companies use magnetic tape:
1. Portability
2. Store larger data than hard drives
3. Cheap
Disadvantage:
1. Slow access time
2. Non reliability

### Optical Storage
Optical storage is a mean of storing data in which data is written and read with a laser on a medium for archival purposes. 
Optical media are more durable than tape and less vulnerable to environmental condition. 
However, presently optical media are slower than typical hard drive speeds, and offer lower storage capacities. 
Digital Versatile Disk (DVD).

Flash Storage Devices: A USB flash drive It is a NAND type flash memory data storaage device integrated with a USB (Universal Serial Bus) connector. They have 10 years of data retention. They are compact, faster, hold more data and more reliable for the lack of moving parts and more durable design. 
NAND flash memory is a type of non-volatile storage technology that do not require power to retain data.
