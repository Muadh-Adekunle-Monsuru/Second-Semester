Cashless policy is part of digital economy initiative, which happened to be a new dimension in the global economy. As an ICT student, conduct a thorough Xray to this policy vis a vis:

**1- Infrastructural readiness**

A fully cashless policy is one where all transactions are done electronically, without the use of physical money. This requires a robust and reliable infrastructure that can support various forms of digital payments, such as mobile money, cards, and online banking. Some of the key components of such an infrastructure are:

- A widespread network of internet access and mobile coverage, especially in rural and remote areas. 
		According to Statista, in 2017 the 3G mobile broadband coverage in Nigeria is estimated to be 44 percent, while 4G connection was at 4 percent. This is a very poor coverage for a country which plans to implement a cashless system nationwide. Transactions cant occur on rural and less densely populated areas meaning farmers and other low skilled workers wouldn't be opportune to sell their produce. 


- A secure and interoperable system of payment platforms and service providers, that can facilitate seamless and low-cost transactions across different channels and devices.
		Almost every single Nigeria has experienced one or more transaction breakdown, where transfers are failed to be seen by recipient or a very long delay in reflection of the transactions on the receiving side. Banks are not working together to create a cohesive and seamless system to facilitate error free transactions and users. 




**2- The effect of the policy on the populace**


 The effect of such a policy on the populous a country like Nigeria can be both positive and negative.
###### Advantages
- Reduced corruption and tax evasion: A cashless policy can make it easier for the government to track and monitor transactions, which can reduce the opportunities for corruption and tax evasion. This can improve the transparency and accountability of public institutions, government official, and increase the revenue for development projects.
- Traceable movement of money: Nigeria is a country riddled with kidnaping and ransoming, a cashless policy could reduce ransoms as the money paid can be tracked by agencies which could lead to the arrest of perpetrators 

###### Disadvantages:
- Higher costs and risks: However, a cashless policy can also entail higher costs and risks for the populus. For instance, some people may face difficulties in accessing or using digital payments due to lack of infrastructure, literacy, or trust. Some people may also incur fees or charges for using digital payments, which can reduce their purchasing power. Moreover, a cashless policy can expose the populus to cyberattacks, frauds, or system failures that can compromise their privacy and security.


**3- Possible improved approach**
One of the best  approaches for an African country to implement cashless policy is to adopt a mobile money platform that is accessible, affordable and secure.
Mobile money allows users to send and receive payments using their phones, without the need for bank accounts or physical cash.
This can reduce transaction costs, increase financial inclusion and promote economic growth.
A mobile money platform should be regulated by the central bank, supported by a network of agents and merchants, and integrated with other digital services such as e-commerce and government payments.
Lots of mobile money platforms have started to become well none across the country, such as Opay, Palmpay and Kuda. These platforms outperform traditional banks in transferring and conducting online payment 

**4-Your personal experience**
My personal experience with the cashless policy has been riddled with extreme dissatisfaction and disappointment, like other citizens. Our traditional banks are still slow and inefficient with transfers feeling like a flip of coin, whether it would be successful or not. Time and time again money would be debited from my account and fails to reach the recipient immediately, worst still, is when the money 'hangs' in the middle, not reaching the recipient and not getting refunded to me. 

It wasn't after I switched to Opay that my experience improved drastically. Transfer is fast easy to make and reliable for the most part. Other users have also commended the reliability of the app. 

Frankly, I don't believe Nigeria is ready for a 'cashless' policy, lots of infrastructure development still needs to be made to allow seamless wireless transactions.
