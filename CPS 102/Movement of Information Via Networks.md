Refers to transmission of data, from one device to another over a network such as the internet.
Ways of moving information:
1. Packet Switching: Method of transmitting data in which the data is broken up into small packets and sent over the network. Each packet contains the address of the destination, and the packets are reassembled at receiving end
2. Routing: It is the process of selecting the shortest path of a data to travel through the network
3. Switching;  Process of connecting devices together to enable communication between them. Switches connect multiple devices together within a network
4. TCP; Transmission Control protocol: a protocol used to ensure reliable delivery of data over the network 
5. IP: Its is protocol used to route data packets between devices on a network, each device on a network is assigned a unique IP.

### Fundamental Set of Communication Technology Concepts


Communication Technology refers to the method, tools, and techniques. That are used to transmit and receive information over a distance.
- Bandwidth: Refers to the range of frequency, that can be transmitted over a communcation channel, eg: wireless
- Modulation
- Multiplexing
- Network Topologies
- Routing
- Latency
- Security
