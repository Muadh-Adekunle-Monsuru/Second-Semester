Two main types of network configuration:
- Peer-to-peer Networks
- Client/Server Networks

**Peer-to-Peer Networks:** Usually implemented in a low security environment between less than 10 computers. Each computer has the same footing. These networks are used to share documents, printers and scanners.

**Client/Server Networks:** A high performance computer/system acts as the central computer, which stores files and application shared on the network. This is referred to as the server. Other computers which requestes these files and applications from the server are called the client.

Peer-to-Peer Networks | Client/Server Networks
--- | ---
Easy to setup | Difficult to set up
Less expensive to install | More expensive to install
Time consuming to maintain softwares | Less, most maintenance is managed from the server
Low levels of security supported | High level of security supported, which are controlled from the server
Ideal for less than 10 computers | No limits
Doesnt require a server | Requires a server running a server operating system


#### Basic components of a network:
- A minimum of at least 2 computers
- Network Cables
- Network Interface cards on each computer
- A switch
- Network operating system software

---
### Network Hardware:
#### Cabling
- Twisted-pair (10BaseT)
- Thin Coax (10Base2)

10BaseT: It cannot exceed 325feet in length. Because all the cables from all the clients converge at a common point, a 10BaseT network forms a star configuration.

#### Network Interface Card
Also known as a network card.It provices the physical interface between computer and cabling. It connects the computer to the cabling, which links the computers together. Computers with a wireless connection to a network would use a wireless network card. It prepares data, sends data and controls the flow of data. It also receives and translate data into bytes for the CPU to understand

#### Repeaters
Simple devices which allow a cabling system to extend beyond its maximum allowed length, by amplifying the network  voltage.
Disadvantage:
- Since they just amplify signals they also amplify the noise, therefore a network with multiple repeaters can 'drown' out the actual signal
#### Hub and Switch
A hub is used to join different computers on a network, it is to direct information around the network, facilitating communication between all connected devices. 
Types:
- Passive Hub: Simply connect all ports together electrically and are usually not powered
- Active Hub: Use electronics to amplify and clean up the signal before it is broadcast to the other ports
-
A network switch is a networking device that connects network segments.
Switches are capable of inspecting data packets a they are received, and forwarding it to the destination.

A switch is often termed a smart hub, With switching, each connection gets "dedicated bandwidth" and can operate at full speed. In contrast, a hub shares bandwidth across multiple connections such that the activity from one PC slows down the speed of other connections.

### Bridges
They join similar topologies and are used to divide network segments, they can filter out noise.
Disadvantage:
They can't connect dissimilar network types.

### Routers:
Highly Intelligent devices that connect multiple network types and determine the best path for sending data.
They can segment large networks and can filter out noise.
Slower and more expensive than bridges.


#### Wireless Network
The term wireless network refers to two or more computers communicating using standard network rules or protocoles, but withtout the use of cabling to connect the computers together.

A WLAN(wireless LAN) consists of:
- An access Point (base station)
- Wireless Card

A WLAN can be installed as the sole network, however it can also be used to extend an exisiting wired network to areas where wiring would be too difficult to implement. 

Advantages of WLAN:
- It's easier to add or remove workstations
- Easy to provide connectivity in difficult to reach areas
- Access to the network can be from anywhere within the range
- Portability of devices
- Installation cost lower than LAN
- Connect buildings without need for cabling
- Useful for environment which cabling is not feasible


Disadvantages of WLAN;
- As the number of computers on a network increase the date transfer rate to each computer will decrease
- Lower bandwidth of wlan makes LAN more effective
- Security is more difficult to guarantee, and requires configuration
- Wired LAN is usually required to provide a backbone to the Wireless LAN

Wireless Network Components:
- Require Network Interface Cards
- A PC require a wireless NIC, which contains in-built antenna
- Access Point: Similar function to the hub in a LAN, access point receives and broadcasts signals to and from the surrounding computers
- No cabling required

Wireless Networks Configurations
- Ad-hoc/peer-to-peer arrangment
- Local Area Network

Ad-hoc: Using the wireless network cards in computers, computers communicate with each other directly to form the network. The devices must remain within the range of each other.


Wireless Network Configurations:
- Access points are more costly than wired counterparts
- Wireless networks are usually slower than wired network
- Wireless Network are less reliable as signal can be affected by mediums such as wall
- Slower when a group of users are downloading large files

Advantages of Networking Students:
- Speed: Fast method for sharing files
- Cost: Network version of most programs are cheaper than buying individual license copies
- Centralized Software Management: All software can be loaded on one server. Which eliminates the need to spend time and energy installing updates and tracking files on independent computers
- Resource Sharing: Resources such as printers, fax machines, modems
- Flexible Access: Student are able to access their files from any computer throughout the school
- Security: Files and programs can be blocked from being copied

Disadvantages of Networking Students:
- Costs: Initialy costs of setup and installation is high
- Requires Administrative time: proper maintenance requires time and expertise
- File Server Failure: When a file server goes down the entire network may come to a half
