a) Computer networking is the practice of connecting multiple computing devices together in order to share resources and communicate with each other. This can be done through various means such as wired or wireless connections.

b) The 5 basic network application areas are: email, file transfer, remote login, World Wide Web and peer-to-peer networking.

c) Some key issues of computer networks include security concerns, network congestion and slow performance, compatibility issues between different devices and systems, and the need for proper network management and maintenance.

d) There are several types of network topologies, each with its own merits and demerits. For example:
- Bus topology: It is easy to set up and implement but has limited cable length and is heavily dependent on the central bus.
- Ring topology: It has high-speed data transmission but the failure of a single node can cause the entire network to fail.
- Star topology: It is easy to add new nodes but the health of the central switch is vital.
- Mesh topology: It can handle heavy traffic and has alternate paths for data transmission but requires a large amount of cable and is difficult to administer.
- Tree topology: It links together groups of nodes in a hierarchical layout but can be vulnerable to failure if a root node has a problem.

e) Some considerations for choosing the right topology include budget, hardware resources, ease of implementation, size of the network, performance needs and redundancy requirements. Scalability is also an important factor to consider.


2. (a) The history of networking dates back to the 1960s when the first computer networks were developed. These early networks were primarily used by government agencies and research institutions.

(b) Early communication networks faced several problems such as limited coverage, low speed, and unreliability.

(c) (i) Multiplexing is a method of combining multiple signals into one signal over a shared medium. (ii) Baseband transmissions typically use digital signaling over a single wire and occupy the entire bandwidth of the network media to transmit a single data signal. (iii) Broadband uses analog signals in the form of optical or electromagnetic waves over multiple transmission frequencies.

3. Briefly discussing the following hardware components:
a. File Servers: A file server is a computer responsible for storing and managing files within a network.
b. Workstations: A workstation is a computer connected to a network that is used by an individual for their work.
c. Network Interface Cards: A network interface card (NIC) provides the physical connection between a computer and a network.
d. Switches: A switch is a networking device that connects multiple devices together and directs data traffic between them.
e. Repeaters: A repeater is a device that amplifies and regenerates a signal to extend the distance it can travel within a network.
f. Bridges: A bridge is a device that connects two separate networks and filters data traffic between them by reading the MAC addresses of the source and destination.
g. Routers: A router is a device that directs data traffic between multiple networks and determines the best path for data to travel.

4. (a) In networking, topology refers to the arrangement of nodes and connections in a network.
(b) Geometric representations of computer network topology include bus, star, ring, tree, and mesh topologies.
(c) Protocols are sets of rules that define how data is transmitted over a network. Examples include TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.

5. (a) The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a standard design for computer networks communications involving 7 layers, each playing a specific role when applications are communicating over the net.
(b) The OSI model has 7 layers while the TCP/IP model has 4 layers. The OSI model separates the functions of the application, presentation, and session layers into separate layers while these functions are combined into the application layer in the TCP/IP model.
