# Cabling
### Three main types of network cables
 - coaxial
 - twisted-pair
 - fiber-optic

**What are coaxial cables**
This cable contains a conductor, insulator, braiding, and sheath. The sheath covers the braiding, braiding covers the insulation, and the insulation covers the conductor

**coaxial cable can be categorized into two types;**
- single-core coaxial cable 
- multi-core coaxial cable

**What are fiber optic cables**
Fiber optic uses **light** to send data. It reflects light from one endpoint to another.

**Components of a fiber optic cable**
- The core is made from the thin strands of glass or plastic that can carry data over the long distance. 
- The core is wrapped in the cladding; 
- The cladding is wrapped in the buffer, 
- The buffer is wrapped in the jacket

 **Types of fiber optic cables**:
- **Single-mode fiber:** This cable carries only a single beam of light. This is more reliable and supports much higher bandwidth and longer distances than the MMF cable.
- **Multi-mode fiber:** this cable carries multiple beams of light. Because of multiple beams, this cable carries much more data than the SMF cable

**Types of twisted pair cables**
 **Straight Through Cable**
	A straight through cable is a type of twisted pair cable that is used in local area networks to connect a computer to a network hub such as a router.

**What Is Crossover Cable**
	A crossover Ethernet cable is a type of Ethernet cable used to connect computing devices together directly. It is most often used to connect two devices of **the same type:** e.g. two computers (via network interface controller) or two switches to each other.

**What are crimping tools**
1. To cut the network cable of the required length from the bundle.
2. To remove the outer and inner jackets of the network cable.
3. To attach the connectors on both ends of the cable.

**A network cable testing and troubleshooting tool is used for**
- To measure the length of a segment or network cable.
- To detect loose connectors.
- To identify an un-labeled network cable from all network cables.
- To find a break in the network cable.
- To certify the cable installation.
