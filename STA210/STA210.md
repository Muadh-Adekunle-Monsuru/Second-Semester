**What is a random variable**
It is a numerical valued function defined on every element in a sample space.
**Sample space:** The total possible outcome of an experiment
A discrete random variable is a random variable that can take on at most a countable number of possible values.

Properties of discrete random variable:
1. $p(x) \geq 0$
2. $\sum_{x=1}^n p(x) =1$ 
3. $p(a<x<b) =\sum_{x=a}^b p(x)$

Continuous random variable are a random variable that can assume an uncountable set of possible values. A random variable X is defined to be a continuous random variable if a non-ve function f(x) defined for all real $x \epsilon (-\infty <x <\infty)$ have the following properties:

Properties of continuous random variable:
1.$f(x) \geq 0$
2. $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) dx = 1$
3. $\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx = p(a<x<b)$

the function f(x) is called the probability density function of random variable.
