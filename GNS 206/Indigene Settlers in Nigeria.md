# Indigene Settlers in Nigeria
[18/04/2023]
The only mention of the word 'indigene' in the 1999 constitution was when it stipulated that a government cabinet must comprise of an indigene from every state of the country.

Currently a person's indigene depends on the indigene of one's parent. Regardless is one is born in another state and grow up their, one would still inherit their parent's state of origin.

Though the constitution states that their should be no discriminations with regards to the indigene of a citizen, their is always discrimination in every state regarding the origin of an individual. 

**Areas of discrimination  regarding indigenes**:
- Tertiary Education Admission
- Differential tuition fees
- Denial of employment
- Denial of Political Candidacy

**Women are marginalized more than men in the political setting**:
- By setting odd meeting hours, which would make married women unlikely to attend meetings
- Violent threats to women's life by opponents
- Lack of resources
- Disapproval of marriage outside their culture: if a woman marries outside her cultural heritage it would be difficult for  her to hold public office, both in her home-state and her husband's state


**Solutions to discrimination**:
- Remove anywhere indigene appears in the constitution and only rely on merits of an individual for every thing in the country. 
	- This is not favorable to the people with underdeveloped environment where education is not engrained in the culture
- 10 years residency: If a person has lived for 10 years in a state, the person can then become a citizen of the state
