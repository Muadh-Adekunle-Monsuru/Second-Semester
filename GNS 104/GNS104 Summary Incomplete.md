 The word ‘science’ is derived from the Latin word, ‘scientia’ which means ‘Knowledge’.
- **Science was defined in terms of**
	(a) a body of knowledge;
	(b) a method for acquiring knowledge, and
	(c) an institution.
**Science as a body of knowledge:** The bodies of knowledge generally regarded as science include, chemistry, biology, physics, mathematics, microbiology, pharmacy and medicine. These bodies of knowledge differ from other forms of knowledge such as religion and art in both content and form.

**Science as a method of acquiring knowledge:** Science has well-known procedures for obtaining knowledge. 
The scientific method:
- Observation
- Problem Hypothesis
- Formulation
- Experimentation
- conclusion
- Theory Formulation

  - **Science as an institution:** Can be viewed as an institution which comprises millions of experts.

Science can be Grouped in two ways
1. Group 1: [Formal Science] + [Empirical Science]
2. Group 2: [Social Science] + [Natural Science]
**Formal Science:** Utilizes concepts, rules and theories, and expresses them in quantitative and statistical manner.

**Empirical Science:** They study objects and phenomena which can be observed through any of the senses and which can be tested with instruments such as telescope, microscope, ruler, tapes and scales.  Includes physics, chemistry, biology, psychology. 
Anything that cannot be observed with the senses or instruments is outside empirical science.

Group 2:
		1. Natural Sciences
		2. Social Natural 
  Sub-branches of Natural Science:
		(a) Physical sciences, which include disciplines like physics, chemistry, geology, applied mathematics, astronomy, etc. These deal with physical and inanimate objects such as rocks, rivers, and mountains.
		(b) Biological sciences. Disciplines under it include biology, zoology, botany, microbiology. These deal with living bodies such as human beings, animals, insects and plants. 
		(c) Medical sciences. They include general medicine, anatomy, surgery, physiology, and veterinary medicine. These disciplines deal with objects and problems that affect human and animal health.
		(d) Pharmaceutical sciences, which include pharmaceutics,pharmaceutical chemistry, pharmacognosy and pharmacology. 

The differences between the disciplines arise as differences of viewpoint between the scientists. In other words, the significant thing is not that chemistry differs from physics, but that the chemist's view of the world differs from that of the physicist.

• The purpose of science is to enable human beings to explain,
predict and to control nature.
• Non-science disciplines are said to be subjective, unverifiable,
non-factual, not systematic and not quantifiable, examples: Religion, Art, Metaphysics, Mysticism.

Though it should be noted that science itself involves a certain degree of speculation and imagination especially at the level of formulating hypotheses.

Science is a powerful way of understanding the natural world and generating useful technologies. Science can help us solve many practical problems, such as finding new sources of energy, curing diseases, and protecting the environment.

However, science also has limitations. Science cannot answer moral, aesthetic, or spiritual questions, such as whether euthanasia is right, whether a painting is beautiful, or whether God exists. Science also cannot prove or disprove the existence of supernatural entities or phenomena. Science only deals with natural causes and effects that can be observed and tested. Therefore, science does not contradict or confirm any religious or philosophical beliefs, but rather provides a different perspective on reality.

## Week 3
## Egypt

More  important  than  all  else,  our  Egyptian  of  the  earliest  historical period was in possession of the art of writing. He had begun to make those specific records  which  were  impossible  to  the  man  of  the  Stone  Age,  and  thus  he  had entered fully upon the way of historical progress which, as already pointed out, has its very foundation in written records. 

The  evidence  seems  to  suggest  than  an  invasion  of  relatively  cultured people from the East overthrew, and in time supplanted, the Neolithic civilization of  the  Nile  Valley.  It  is  impossible  to  date  this  invasion  accurately,  but  it  cannot well  have been  later  than  the year 5000  B.C

Be the exact dates what they may, we find the Egyptian of the fifth millennium B.C. in full possession of a highly organized civilization


They prove that the Egyptian of that  early  day  had  attained  a  knowledge  of  practical  mechanics  which,  even  from the twentieth-century point of view, is not to be spoken of lightly 


Each  separate  part  of  Egypt  had  its  own  hierarchy  of  gods, and  more  or  less  its  own  explanations  of  cosmogony.  There  does  not  appear  to have  been  any  one  central  story  of  creation  that  found  universal  acceptance,  any more than there was one specific deity everywhere recognized as supreme among the  gods.

The  kingdom  of  Egypt  was  divided  into  three  religious  centres,  which were  Memphis,  Heliopolis,  Thebes  or  Hermopolis.  These  centres were  administered  by  priest-scholars.  They  were  called  scholars because they were the intellectual class of the ancient Egyptians. These priest—scholars established a kind of school system known as the Egyptian  Mystery  System    schools.  The  schools  were  a  kind  of  university  where    every  known  discipline    was  taught  by  the  priests. One  of  the  main  stimuli  for    the  origin  of  ancient  Egyptian science was their practical needs in agriculture (such as measuring,  calculations,  surveying  and  study  of  the  weather    and  the heavens). Second is their understanding  of the world they lived  in  through religion and philosophy 


Astronomy    originated    with    the      Egyptians      through      their   study  of  the heavens, the stars   and the weather. They divided the year  into 12 ‘moons’  or ‘months’  of 30 days   each  and added a space of 5  days    to  each  year,  thus    bringing  each  year    to  a  total  of  365  days

Credit is also given to the Egyptians for the origination of  mathematics

The    ancient  Egyptians  were    also  reputed  highly  in  medicine.  They are  said  to  have  performed  caesarean  operations and  removed  cataracts from the eyes. Evidence for these is contained in the Edwin  Papyrus,  which   was  excavated. 

Science originated in Egypt and Babylonia (which is present-day Iraq).
- Egyptian    priest-scholars    established    a      kind    of      school  known  as  the Egyptian Mystery System  Schools where every known discipline was taught by the priests.  
- Evidence for the Egyptian origins of mathematics  and medicine can be found   in   the  Rind   Mathematical   Papyrus  and   the  Edwin   Papyrus respectively. 
- Babylonians  developed the most  descriptive astronomy of  the  ancient world.  
- They  were  the  first  to  divide  the  day  into  hours,  minutes  and seconds and also divided the circle into 360 degrees.  
- Egyptian philosophy is the origin of Western philosophy. Evidence  can  be    found  in  the  writings    of    ancient  Greeks themselves  such  as  Homer  and  Pythagoras,  and  from  modern historians 

## Greek:
Science in ancient Greece will be treated under two headings:   
1.  Pre-socratic philosopher-scientists  
2.  Socratic philosopher-scientists

Pre-socratics  These people  were  known as  natural  philosophers  because  they  engaged  themselves  with  the  study  of    nature  and  the  origin  of    the world

The Socratics  They included Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. 

- Pre-socratics    named  the  original  stuff    from  which  all  things originated and to which they return. 
- Socrates  enriched  science  with  universal  definitions  and   inductive reasoning.  
- Plato formulated the idea of negative numbers  
- Aristotle  wrote  books  on  almost  all  the  areas    of    knowledge  - biology, zoology, physics, astronomy, etc.
- Scientific innovation began to decline in the Roman Empire.  
- The  calendar    invented  by  the  Egyptians  was  modified  further  by Julius Caesar and Pope Gregory III.

## Week 4
The  Middle  Ages  are  also  known  as  the  medieval  period.  The  period was  dominated  by  Christian  Theology  and  characterized  by  initial decline   of science and its rise again much later 

As  a  result  of constant invasions   by   barbarian   tribes  (the      tribes      outside   the   Roman   Empire), civilization which had flourished under the rule of  the  Roman  Empire,  came  to  a  standstill.  Development  in  learning, architecture,  science  and  art  slowed  down  or  stopped  altogether.  Life also  became  unsafe  as  a  result  of  the  many  wars  among  the  petty kingdoms  within  the  Empire.  A  kind  of  ‘darkness’  covered  life  in Europe. For this reason, the period from about AD 450 to 800  is sometimes called the ‘Dark Ages’. 

While Europe was in the Dark Ages, Islamic learning started to flourish in the East. To the Arabs, ancient science was a precious treasure. They eagerly searched for the writings of the Greeks and translated them into their  language.  In  this  way,  much  of  the  ancient  science  passed into  Islamic  culture.  Greek  medicine,  astronomy  and  astrology, mathematics,  philosophical  works  of  Plato  and  particularly,  Aristotle were  assimilated  in  Islam,  by  the  end  of  the  9th  century.  The  Arabs, however, did not stop with assimilation

Their major interest was in Astronomy and  Astrology.  They constructed great astronomical  observatories, which they used in checking Ptolemaic   predictions.   The  Arabs further  made  many  improvements  in  medicine.  In  their  hands,  the primitive chemistry of  the Greeks known as alchemy developed   into  modern chemistry. Rhazes (865 -925)  was  the realest of  the Arabic alchemist.  His  works  were  based  on  experience  and  experiment.  The most  eminent  Muslim  physicist  was  Ibn-al  Haitham  (965  -1020  AD). His  chief  work  was  done  in  optics  and  showed  a  great  advance  in experimental method Islamic  thinkers  were  fascinated with  numbers.  This  fascination  thus served as the motivation for  the creation of algebra (from Arabic: al-Jabr) and  the study of  algebraic functions . They also borrowed the idea of  zero from the Hindu mathematicians and invented the Arabic numerals. Towards    the  end  of    the  medieval  period,  it    was    widely  recognized that  the  East  held  the  secret  of  ancient  wisdom  in  learning  and  science. Thus, the Europeans (west)  developed  interest  in  Arabic  language  and    commenced  translations  of  books  from  Arabic  to  Latin.

Ibn Yoonus worked as an astronomer for the Fatimid dynasty, which ruled Egypt and parts of North Africa and Syria. He made many accurate observations of the sun, moon, planets and stars, using large instruments and meticulous calculations. He wrote a handbook of astronomical tables called al-Zij al-Kabir al-Hakimi, which he dedicated to the Caliph al-Hakim. This work was ahead of its time and contained many original methods and formulas.

Ibn Yoonus was also an astrologer who made predictions based on the movements of celestial bodies. He wrote a book called Kitab bulugh al-umniyya (On the Attainment of Desire), which dealt with the heliacal risings of Sirius and the start of the Coptic year. He was also known as an eccentric and a poet who composed verses on various topics.

### Week 6
Muslim Mathematicians

**Ibn Mussa Al-Khawarizmi**
Al-Khwarizmi was a Persian polymath who lived in the 9th century CE. He is widely regarded as the father of algebra and the originator of the term algorithm. He worked at the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, where he wrote influential books on mathematics, astronomy, geography and other sciences.

One of his most famous books was The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing, which introduced the methods of solving linear and quadratic equations by using algebraic symbols and operations. He also explained how to use Hindu-Arabic numerals and decimal notation for arithmetic calculations. His book was translated into Latin in the 12th century and became the main mathematical textbook in Europe for centuries.

Another important book by Al-Khwarizmi was his revision of Ptolemy's Geography, which corrected and updated the coordinates of many places in the known world. He also produced accurate tables of trigonometric functions, such as sine, cosine and tangent, and wrote about various astronomical and calendrical topics, such as the astrolabe, the sundial and the Islamic calendar.

Al-Khwarizmi's contributions to science and culture were immense and lasting. He influenced many later mathematicians, astronomers and geographers, both in the Islamic world and in Europe. His name is still remembered today in the words algebra and algorithm, which derive from his book titles.

**Al-Samawal**
Al-Samaw'al ibn Yahya al-Maghribi (c. 1130 - c. 1180), also known as Samau'al al-Maghribi, was a **mathematician**, **astronomer** and **physician** from Baghdad. He was born to a Jewish family that had migrated from Morocco. He converted to Islam later in his life. He wrote a famous treatise on algebra called al-Bahir fi'l-jabr, meaning "The brilliant in algebra", when he was only nineteen years old. He also used an early form of mathematical induction to extend the binomial theorem and Pascal's triangle. He was also involved in polemics against Judaism in his book Ifham al-Yahud (Confutation of the Jews).

**Al-Karaji**
Al-Karaji was a Persian mathematician and engineer who lived in the 10th century. He is regarded as the first person to free algebra from geometry and introduce the theory of algebraic calculus. He also wrote on hydrology and engineering, and discovered the binomial theorem and Pascal's triangle. He was influenced by Diophantus and other earlier mathematicians .

**Al-Kāshī**
Al-Kāshī was a Persian mathematician and astronomer who lived in the 15th century. He is best known for his contributions to trigonometry, algebra, arithmetic and astronomy. He wrote several influential books, such as The Key to Arithmetic, The Treatise on the Circumference and The Treatise on the Chord and Sine. He also worked at the observatory of Samarkand under Ulugh Beg, where he made accurate measurements of the solar and lunar eclipses and the length of the tropical year.

**Ibn Khaldun**
Ibn Khaldun was a prominent Arab historian, philosopher, and sociologist who lived in the fourteenth century. He was born in Tunis in 1332 into a noble family that traced its ancestry to Yemen. He received a classical education in Islamic sciences and law, and held various positions as a scholar, judge, and diplomat in North Africa and Spain. He is best known for his book, the Muqaddimah, which he wrote as an introduction to his universal history of the world. In this book, he developed a sophisticated theory of the rise and fall of civilizations, based on concepts such as asabiyyah (social cohesion), umran (urbanization), and al-'umran al-badawi (nomadic culture). He also analyzed the factors that affect the economy, politics, society, and culture of different regions and peoples. He is widely regarded as one of the founders of modern sociology, historiography, and economics.

## Week 7 
Arabs and Astronomy

Some of the most influential Arab astronomers of this period were al-Khwarizmi (780–850), who wrote a zij based on Indian and Persian sources; al-Farghani (800–870), who wrote a popular summary of Ptolemy's Almagest; al-Battani (858–929), who improved the accuracy of astronomical observations and tables; al-Sufi (903–986), who wrote a detailed catalogue of the fixed stars with illustrations; al-Biruni (973–1048), who measured the earth's circumference and discussed various astronomical systems; and Ibn al-Haytham (965–1040), who developed a new theory of vision and optics.

The Arab astronomers also produced many scientific instruments that helped them observe and calculate the celestial phenomena. These included astrolabes, quadrants, sundials, armillary spheres, celestial globes, and clocks. Some of these instruments were used for religious purposes, such as determining the direction of Mecca (qibla) for prayer, the times of sunrise and sunset for fasting during Ramadan, and the appearance of the new moon for marking the beginning of a new month. Others were used for practical purposes, such as navigation, surveying, astrology, and timekeeping.


- The development of trigonometry and spherical geometry, which are essential tools for calculating celestial positions and distances.
- The invention of various astronomical instruments, such as the astrolabe, the quadrant, the sundial, and the armillary sphere, which enabled accurate measurements of celestial phenomena.
- The establishment of numerous observatories across the Islamic world, such as Baghdad, Cairo, Damascus, Maragha, Samarkand, and Toledo, where systematic observations and calculations were carried out.
- The compilation of comprehensive star catalogs and tables of planetary motions, such as the Almagest of Ptolemy revised by al-Battani, the Zij al-Sindhind of al-Khwarizmi, the Zij-i Ilkhani of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, and the Tables of Toledo by al-Zarqali.
- The advancement of theoretical astronomy, such as the development of the Tusi-couple by al-Tusi, which resolved the problem of planetary motion in a geocentric system, and the introduction of the heliocentric model by Ibn al-Shatir and al-Biruni, which anticipated Copernicus by centuries.

## Week 8

Contributions of Arabs to the study of Medicine

The history of medicine is rich with contributions from various civilizations and cultures, and among them, the Arabs played a significant role in advancing the field of medicine. The Arabs were influenced by the ancient Greek, Persian, Indian and Chinese medical traditions, and they synthesized and improved upon them with their own innovations and discoveries. Some of the notable contributions of Arabs to the study of medicine are:

- The establishment of hospitals and medical schools that provided free health care and education to anyone regardless of their religion, ethnicity or social status. The first hospital in Islam was founded by Caliph Harun al-Rashid in Baghdad in the 8th century, and it was equipped with wards, libraries, pharmacies and laboratories. The hospital also had a separate section for mental illnesses, which was a novel concept at the time. The most famous hospital in the Islamic world was the Bimaristan of Cairo, founded by Saladin in the 12th century, which had 800 beds and served 4000 patients daily.
- The development of pharmacology and pharmacy as distinct sciences that involved the identification, classification, preparation and testing of drugs. The Arabs were pioneers in extracting and synthesizing chemical compounds from plants, animals and minerals, and they experimented with various methods of drug delivery such as pills, syrups, ointments and inhalations. They also wrote comprehensive manuals on pharmacology and pharmacy, such as The Canon of Medicine by Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and Al-Qanun fi al-Tibb (The Law of Medicine) by Ibn al-Nafis, which were translated into Latin and other languages and used as textbooks in Europe for centuries.
- The advancement of anatomy and physiology through dissection, observation and experimentation. The Arabs challenged some of the erroneous views of Galen and Aristotle on human anatomy and physiology, and they discovered new facts and phenomena such as the circulation of blood, the function of the lungs, the structure of the eye and the nervous system. They also performed surgical operations such as cauterization, amputation, lithotomy and cataract removal, using instruments such as scalpels, forceps, scissors and needles. They also invented anesthesia by using opium, mandrake and other substances to induce sleep or numbness in patients.
- The innovation of medical ethics and professionalism that emphasized the moral responsibility and accountability of physicians towards their patients and society. The Arabs followed the Hippocratic oath and added their own principles such as compassion, honesty, confidentiality and beneficence. They also established standards and regulations for medical practice such as licensing, certification, examination and peer review. They also wrote treatises on medical ethics such as Al-Risala al-Dhahabiyya (The Golden Treatise) by Al-Razi (Rhazes) and Al-Tibb al-Nabawi (Prophetic Medicine) by Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya.
