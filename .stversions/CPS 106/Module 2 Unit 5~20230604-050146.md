Components of a DBMS
- Data Definition Language
- Data Manipulation Language
- Data Dictionary


- Data Definition Language: It is the component of a DBMS that defines each data as it appears in the database. A DDL is the formal language used by the programmer to specify the content and structure of the database. It defines each elements as it appears in the database before the data element is translated into the form required by the application programs.
- Data Manipulation Language: Its a component of the DBMS that is employed by the end users and  programmers to manipulate data in the database. Most DBMS have DML that is used in conjunction with some conventional third or fourth generation languages to manipulate the data in the database. The language contains commands that permit end users to manipulate the data, extract data from the database to satisfy information request and develop applications. SQL most prominent DML. 
- Data Dictionary: This is an automated or manual file that stores definitions of data elements and data characteristics such as usage, physical representation, ownership, authorization and security. Most DD can produce list and reports of data utilization



Database models are ways of organizing and manipulating data in a database. Different database models have different structures, operations, and methods to store, access, and relate data. Some of the most common database models are:

- Relational model: This model uses tables of data that are grouped and normalized based on their characteristics. Each table has columns (attributes) and rows (records) that can be linked by keys. Relational databases are easy to use, flexible, scalable, precise, and secure.

- Hierarchical model: This model uses a tree-like structure of data that has a single root node and multiple child nodes. Each node can have only one parent node, but can have many child nodes. Hierarchical databases are easy to add and delete data, relate to natural hierarchies, and support one-to-many relationships.

- Network model: This model uses a graph-like structure of data that has multiple nodes and links. Each node can have multiple parent and child nodes, and each link can have multiple records. Network databases support many-to-many relationships and allow faster searches.

- Object-oriented model: This model uses objects of data that have attributes (properties) and methods (functions). Each object can belong to a class (type) that defines its behavior and inheritance. Object-oriented databases support complex data types, encapsulation, polymorphism, and reusability.

- Document model: This model uses documents of data that are stored in a semi-structured or unstructured format. Each document can have different fields (attributes) and values (data). Document databases are flexible, scalable, schema-less, and support nested data.
