**What is a random variable**
It is a numerical valued function defined on every element in a sample space.
**Sample space:** The total possible outcome of an experiment
A discrete random variable is a random variable that can take on at most a countable number of possible values.

Properties of discrete random variable:
1. $p(x) \geq 0$
2. $\sum_{x=1}^n p(x) =1$ 
3. $p(a<x<b) =\sum_{x=a}^b p(x)$

Continuous random variable are a random variable that can assume an uncountable set of possible values. A random variable X is defined to be a continuous random variable if a non-ve function f(x) defined for all real $x \epsilon (-\infty <x <\infty)$ have the following properties:

Properties of continuous random variable:
1.$f(x) \geq 0$
2. $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) dx = 1$
3. $\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx = p(a<x<b)$

the function f(x) is called the probability density function of random variable.


$$
F(x) = \begin{cases}
x^2 & \text{if } x \leq 0 \\
x & \text{if } x > 0
\end{cases}

$$

$$
f(x) = \begin{cases}
\frac{xy^2}{30} & \text{if } x =1,2,3 ;y=1,2 \\
0 & \text{otherwise} 
\end{cases}

$$

To prove that two random variables X and Y are independent, we need to show that the joint probability mass function (pmf) of X and Y can be written as the product of their marginal pmfs. In other words, we need to show that f(x,y) = fX(x) * fY(y) for all x and y.

The given function is a joint pmf since it satisfies the two properties of a pmf: it is non-negative and sums to 1 over its support.

Let's find the marginal pmfs of X and Y:

$$
f_X(x) = \sum_{y=1}^{2} f(x,y) = \sum_{y=1}^{2} \frac{xy^2}{30} = \frac{x}{30}(1+4) = \frac{5x}{30}
$$

for x = 1, 2, 3.

$$
f_Y(y) = \sum_{x=1}^{3} f(x,y) = \sum_{x=1}^{3} \frac{xy^2}{30} = \frac{y^2}{30}(1+2+3) = \frac{6y^2}{30}
$$

for y = 1, 2.

Now let's check if f(x,y) = fX(x) * fY(y):

$$
f_X(x)f_Y(y) = \frac{5x}{30} * \frac{6y^2}{30} = \frac{30xy^2}{900}
$$

Since this is not equal to the given joint pmf f(x,y) = xy^2/30, we can conclude that X and Y are **not independent**. This is derived from my own knowledge. Is there anything else you would like to know? ðŸ˜Š

Consider two discrete random variables $X$ and $Y$. We say that $X$ and $Y$ are independent if $$P\bigg(X=x,Y=y\bigg)=P(X=x) P(Y=y), \hspace{20pt} \textrm{ for all } x,y.$$ In general, if two random variables are independent, then you can write $$P\bigg(X \in A,Y \in B\bigg)=P(X \in A) P(Y \in B), \hspace{20pt} \textrm{ for all sets } A \textrm{ and } B.$$
A fair die is tossed once, let X denots twice the number appearing, and let Y denotes 1 or 3 accordingly as an odd and an even number that appears, find the distribution of x + y
