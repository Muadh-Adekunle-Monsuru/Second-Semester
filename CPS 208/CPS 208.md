### Digital Signal Processing
**Signals**: A signal can be defined as any physical quantity that varies with time, space or any other independent variable. 

DSP is concerned with the digital representation signals and the use of signal processors to analyze, modify or extract information from signals. Most signals in nature are in analogue form, meaning that they vary continuously with time and represent the variation of physical quantities, such as sound waves.

### Computer Architecture

Computer architecture is the acts and science of building computers. It has to specify the performance requirements of various parts of the computer system. To define interconnections between the various parts of a computer and to keep the computer harmoniously balanced. 
Types of computer architecture
- Vaun Neuman Architecture: It describes a general framework or structure that a computer's hardware, programming and data should follow.  Although other structures for computing have being devised and implemented, the vast majority of computer they use today operate according to the Von Neuman Architecture. Contains the components
			- ALU: Arithmetic and Logical Unit
			- RAM: Random Access Memory
			- Control Units
			- Man to Machine Interfaces

**What is Computer Organization**:
It refers to the logical aspects of an implementation on a computer, in other words, it refers to the high level aspects of the design, cpu design, memory system and bus memory structure of  the computer.

**What is Implementation:**
Implementation on a computer refers to the logical and physical design techniques used to represent an instance of the computer architecture. It is possible to have different implementation for some architecture, in the same way their are different possibility of building an house using the same plan. 

**Instruction Set Architecture**:
It refers to what the programmer sees as the machines instruction set. The instruction set is the boundary between the hardware and the software and most of the decisions concerning the instruction set affects the hardware adversely or beneficiary.

### Computer Performance

Performance of a computer in the view of a user will consider the response time or execution time 
of the system. 

While in the view of a system manager will consider the throughput/bandwidth which is the number of jobs done in a certain amount of time.

#### Effect of System Enhancement on Response Time & Throughput

Considering the following two system enhancement:
1. Faster CPU
2. Separate processors for different tasks

Does the two system enhance improve the response time, throughput, or both. 

For case 1, both response time and throughput are increased. For, case 2, multiple task can be processed at the same time, but no one gets done faster, hence only throughput is improved. 


Suppose we have to compare two machines A & B, the phrase is n% faster than B means that 
$$\frac{ExecutionTimeOfB}{ExecutionTimeOfA} = 1 + \frac{n}{100}$$

Performance of reciprocal of execution time. 

$$\frac{PerformanceA}{PerformanceB} = 1 + \frac{n}{100}$$

Example
If machine A runs a program in 5 seconds and machine B runs the same program in 6 seconds, how can the execution time of both machines be compared. 

$$\frac{6}{5} = 1 + \frac{n}{100}$$

$$\frac{6}{5}-1 = \frac{n}{100}$$
$$\frac{1}{5}= \frac{n}{100}$$

$$n = 20$$
Therefore A is 20% faster than machine B. The execution time of machine A is 20% than that of machine B.

### Steps to perform WRITE operation.
In a specified memory location 
1.  The word to be stored in the memory location, is first loaded by the CPU into a specific register, called memory **data** register. 
2. The address of the location into which the word is to be stored, is loaded by the CPU into a specified register, called memory **address** register. 
3. A signal referred to as WRITE is issued by the CPU, indicating that the word stored in the MDR is to be stored in the memory location whose address is loaded in the MAR

### Steps to perform READ operation.
In a specified memory location
1. The address of the location from which the word is to be read is loaded into the memory address register. MAR
2. A signal called READ is issued by the CPU, indicating that the word whose address is in the MAR is to be READ into the MDR. 
3. After some time corresponding to the memory delay in reading the specified word the required word would be loaded by the memory into the MDR ready for the use by the CPU.

### Building Blocks of a computer
[19/04/2023]


Today's generation of computers are called Neuman's computer simply because their main building parts, CPU or Processor, memory and I/O are connected in the way of Vaun Neuman as represented in the diagram.

The CPU is the core of the computer, where all the computations are done. The whole system is also controlled by the CPU.

Memory: This is where the program and the data for the program are stored.

I/O; The input and output provides means of entering the program and the data into the system. It also allows the user to get the result of the computation. 

### Computation control in CPU
The computation part of the CPU is called the data patch, it contains most of the CPUS states, which is the information the programmer save when the program is suspended, restoring this information makes the computation looks like nothing had happened.
The CPU states include:
- Program Counter (PC)
- Interrupt Address Register (IAR)
- Program Status Register (PSR)

The CPU consists of:
- ALU: Arithmetic and Logical units: which performs the arithmetic and logical operations
- Registers: which hold variables or intermediary results of computation, as well as special purposes.
- Interconnections: Between the internal buses.

#### Digital Logic Family

**Digital Logic Family:** It is the classification of ICs by the specific circuit technology to which they belong the basic circuit in each technology is [NAND, NOR and NOT] Gates, the earliest logic family was Resistor Transistor Logic( Which used resistors as inputs and transistors as switching device) 

- DTL (Diode Transistor Logic)
- TTL (Transistor Transistor Logic)
- ECL( Emitter Couple Logic)

- **DTL (Diode Transistor Logic)**: It is a direct ancestor to the TTL, and it used a diode for logic functions, and a transistors for amplifying functions.
- **TTL (Transistor Transistor Logic)**: It is the modified form of DTL, the diodes were replaced by transistor to improve the circuit operation. It is called a transistor to transistor logic because, transistors perform **both** the logic functions and the amplifying functions. 
	- since the power dissipation does not depend on the frequency, the power speed does not increase with clock speed.
	- Compared to ECL circuits, TTL uses less power but is comparatively slower. 
	- TTL is less prone to damage due to electrostatic discharge. 
	- Before VLSI devices TTL circuits were used in the construction of processors for minicomputers and mainframe computers. 
	**Advantages of TTL**:
	- They are fast
	- It has low propagation delay
	- Power dissipation does not depend upon the frequency. 
- **ECL( Emitter Couple Logic)** It provides highest speeds digital circuit, it is used in systems such as supercomputers and signal processors where high speed is required. 
	- In an ECL circuits each gate continuously draws current when inactive, hence the power consumption is more compared to other logic families. 
	- The large current requirement of ECL is constant and does not depend on the state of the circuit, which is the reason for low power noise.
 **Advantages:**
	- Fastest Logic Family
	- Propagation Delay is Less
	- Noise margin is extremely low`
