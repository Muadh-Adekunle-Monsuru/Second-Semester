## Computer Architecture & Organization 

[29/03/2023]
A computer is a device that takes input processes it and gives an output
It input is data, which are raw fact. 
the output is information. which is processed data

### Classes of computer
- Mainframe computer
- Mini Computer
- Super Computer
- Micro Computers

	- **Mainframe Computers**: These are large computers that can support, many users while delivering great computing power. It is mainly in mainframe computers where most of the innovations both in architecture and in organization are being made.   
	- **Mini Computers**: They have adopted many of the mainframe techniques. But it is cheaper compared to mainframe computers, and satisfying the computing needs for smaller group of users. It is mainly based on the evolution of integrated circuit technology. 
	- **Super Computers**: They are designed for scientific applications. They are the most expensive computers. Processing is usually in batches for reason of good performance. 
	- **Micro Computers**: They are based on micro processor technology, the term micro refers only to the physical dimension of the computer and not to the computing performance. They are a direct product of technological advancements. Fast CPUs,  and semiconductor memory.

### Digital Signal Processing
**Signals**: A signal can be defined as any physical quantity that varies with time, space or any other independent variable. 

DSP is concerned with the digital representation signals and the use of signal processors to analyze, modify or extract information from signals. Most signals in nature are in analogue form, meaning that they vary continuously with time and represent the variation of physical quantities, such as sound waves.

### Computer Architecture

Computer architecture is the acts and science of building computers. It has to specify the performance requirements of various parts of the computer system. To define interconnections between the various parts of a computer and to keep the computer harmoniously balanced. 

**What is Computer Organization**:
It refers to the logical aspects of an implementation on a computer, in other words, it refers to the high level aspects of the design, cpu design, memory system and bus memory structure of  the computer.

**What is Implementation:**
Implementation on a computer refers to the logical and physical design techniques used to represent an instance of the computer architecture. It is possible to have different implementation for some architecture, in the same way their are different possibility of building an house using the same plan. 

**Instruction Set Architecture**:
It refers to what the programmer sees as the machines instruction set. The instruction set is the boundary between the hardware and the software and most of the decisions concerning the instruction set affects the hardware adversely or beneficiary.

### Computer Performance

Performance of a computer in the view of a user will consider the response time or execution time 
of the system. 

While in the view of a system manager will consider the throughput/bandwidth which is the number of jobs done in a certain amount of time.

#### Effect of System Enhancement on Response Time & Throughput

Considering the following two system enhancement:
1. Faster CPU
2. Separate processors for different tasks

Does the two system enhance improve the response time, throughput, or both. 

For case 1, both response time and throughput are increased. For, case 2, multiple task can be processed at the same time, but no one gets done faster, hence only throughput is improved. 


Suppose we have to compare two machines A & B, the phrase is n% faster than B means that 
$$\frac{ExecutionTimeOfB}{ExecutionTimeOfA} = 1 + \frac{n}{100}$$

Performance of reciprocal of execution time. 

$$\frac{PerformanceA}{PerformanceB} = 1 + \frac{n}{100}$$

Example
If machine A runs a program in 5 seconds and machine B runs the same program in 6 seconds, how can the execution time of both machines be compared. 

$$\frac{6}{5} = 1 + \frac{n}{100}$$

$$\frac{6}{5}-1 = \frac{n}{100}$$
$$\frac{1}{5}= \frac{n}{100}$$

$$n = 20$$
Therefore A is 20% faster than machine B. The execution time of machine A is 20% than that of machine B.

### Steps to perform WRITE operation.
In a specified memory location 
1.  The word to be stored in the memory location, is first loaded by the CPU into a specific register, called memory **data** register. 
2. The address of the location into which the word is to be stored, is loaded by the CPU into a specified register, called memory **address** register. 
3. A signal referred to as WRITE is issued by the CPU, indicating that the word stored in the MDR is to be stored in the memory location whose address is loaded in the MAR
