A computer is a device that takes input processes it and gives an output
It input is data, which are raw fact. 
the output is information. which is processed data

### Classes of computer
- Mainframe computer
- Mini Computer
- Super Computer
- Micro Computers

	- **Mainframe Computers**: These are large computers that can support, many users while delivering great computing power. It is mainly in mainframe computers where most of the innovations both in architecture and in organization are being made.   
	- **Mini Computers**: They have adopted many of the mainframe techniques. But it is cheaper compared to mainframe computers, and satisfying the computing needs for smaller group of users. It is mainly based on the evolution of integrated circuit technology. 
	- **Super Computers**: They are designed for scientific applications. They are the most expensive computers. Processing is usually in batches for reason of good performance. 
	- **Micro Computers**: They are based on micro processor technology, the term micro refers only to the physical dimension of the computer and not to the computing performance. They are a direct product of technological advancements. Fast CPUs,  and semiconductor memory.
