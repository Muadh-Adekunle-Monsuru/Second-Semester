### Assignment 1
Write extensively on digital signal processing of a computer DSP.  

Digital Signal Processing refers to the various techniques for improving the accuracy and reliability of digital communications. The DSP acts directly on the incoming signal, eliminating irregularities caused by noise, and therefore minimizing the number of errors per unit time. 

Digital Signal Processing is a subfield of signal processing, which also entails analogue signal processing. 

The digital signal processor takes in real-world signals like voice, audio, temperature and pressure that have been digitized and then mathematically manipulates them based on the DSP function. 

Signals are processed so that the information they contain can be analyzed, displayed or converted to another type of signal. 

The digital signals processed in this manner are a sequence of numbers that represent samples of a conitnuous variable, such as time. 
## A basic implementation of DSP

If an incoming signal is analog, the signal if first converted to digital form by an analog-to-digital converter ADC. The resulting digital signal has two or more levels. The DSP circuit adjusts the levels so they are at the correct values. The digital signal can then be converted back to analog form via a digital-to-analog converter DAC.

In a real-world example:
Analog sensors detect signals such as sound, ADC converts the signal into digital form of 1's and 0's. From there the DSP takes the digitized information and processes it. It can then feed the processed information back into the real world. Either to be displayed or analyzed. 

Uses:
A DSP can be used by a computer to control such things as security cameras, telephone, home temperature regulation. 

### What is inside a DSP
A DSP contains these key components:
- **Program Memory**: Stores the programs the DSP will use to process data
- **Data Memory**: Stores the information to be processed
- **Compute Engine**: Performs the math processing, accessing the program from the Program Memory and the data from the Data Memory
- **Input/Output**: Serves a range of functions to connect to the outside world.

## DSP Applications:
- Audio
- Speech Processing
- SONAR
- RADAR
- Spectral Density Estimation
