#### Hardware Components
- Processor(s)
- Memory
- I/O Devices

The motherboard holds all the main hardware components of the computer, such as 
- Slots- for processors, memory and other devices
- Bus- Provides high speed communication 
- Chips: BIOS, Controllers

A processor is a hardware component that executes a stream of machine language. e.g CPU, Graphics Processor, DSP

Clocks, a computer time is measured in cycles. A cycle refers to one complete oscillation of an electrical signal provided by the system clock generator. 
System clock generator decides the frequency at which buses transfer data, measured in cycles per second or Hz

### Buses
