Learning a second language opens doors to various personal and professional opportunities. Someone who can speak more than one language can build a relationship with native speakers be it a personal or professional one. Occasionally, one might make livelong friendships with people who do not share the same native tongue. Additionally, many recruiters favor applicants who can communicate in more than one language, which is seen as a valuable asset when dealing with diverse customers. Furthermore, recruiters consider a multilingual applicant as someone who is well exposed and ready to learn new things, hence a better candidate for the job. 


Learning a second language can open doors to a variety of personal and professional opportunities. For example, multilingual people can build relationships with native speakers, both personally and professionally. They may even make lifelong friends with people who do not share their native tongue. In the workplace, multilingual applicants are seen as valuable assets, as they can communicate with diverse customers and colleagues. Additionally, multilingual applicants are often seen as being more open-minded and adaptable, which can be a major advantage in today's globalized world.

Use stronger verbs and more active voice. The paragraph currently uses some weak verbs, such as "can" and "might." Using stronger verbs would make the paragraph more powerful and engaging. For example, the student could say "Multilingual applicants are seen as valuable assets when dealing with diverse customers" instead of "Multilingual applicants are seen as someone who can communicate in more than one language."
Vary the sentence structure. The paragraph currently uses a lot of simple sentences. Varying the sentence structure would make the paragraph more interesting to read. For example, the student could use a compound sentence to combine two related ideas, or they could use a complex sentence to add a subordinate clause.
