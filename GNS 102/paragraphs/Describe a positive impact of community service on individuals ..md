Community service helps to develop a sense of responsibility in an individual. For instance, a person who volunteers to clean the community would feel responsible for the cleanliness of the community. This would encourage the individual to ensure the environment is always kempt where ever they are. Furthermore, the individual would also make it their responsibility  to encourage other people to do the same. Additionally, the individual would feel empowered to take charge in developing and assisting the community in other aspects.

Mention ways in which this student's paragraph can be improved,
Here are some ways in which the student's paragraph can be improved:

1. Sentence structure: The paragraph could benefit from more varied sentence structures to improve readability. Currently, most sentences follow a similar structure, which can make the writing feel repetitive. 

Example revision: "Community service fosters a sense of responsibility within individuals. For instance, when someone volunteers to clean the community, they develop a personal commitment to maintaining its cleanliness. This responsibility extends beyond their immediate surroundings, motivating them to promote cleanliness elsewhere. Moreover, they feel empowered to take the lead in community development and support in various ways."

2. Clarity and specificity: The paragraph could be clearer and more specific in its examples and statements. Adding specific details can enhance the reader's understanding and engagement with the topic.

Example revision: "Community service cultivates a strong sense of responsibility in individuals. Consider someone who volunteers regularly to clean up their neighborhood park. This commitment instills a personal obligation to uphold cleanliness not only in the park but also in other places they visit. Additionally, they take it upon themselves to inspire and motivate others to adopt the same responsible behavior. As a result, they gain confidence in their ability to initiate positive changes and contribute to various aspects of community development."

3. Transition words: The paragraph lacks transitional words and phrases, making the flow of ideas feel disjointed. Introducing appropriate transitions can help connect sentences and improve the overall coherence of the paragraph.

Example revision: "Community service plays a pivotal role in fostering a sense of responsibility in individuals. By way of illustration, imagine someone who dedicates their time to volunteering for community clean-up initiatives. Through this experience, they develop a profound sense of duty towards maintaining cleanliness not just within their immediate surroundings, but wherever they go. Furthermore, they assume the responsibility of encouraging others to participate in these efforts. Consequently, they gain a sense of empowerment and take initiative in contributing to other aspects of community development."

By incorporating these improvements, the paragraph becomes more engaging, clear, and coherent, effectively conveying the impact of community service on personal responsibility.
