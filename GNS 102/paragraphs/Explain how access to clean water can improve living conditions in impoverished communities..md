A community with access to clean water would experience fewer disease outbreaks. Undoubtedly, water is the source of life for human beings, we drink and use it in the daily preparation of food. Consequently, if the water source in a community is contaminated, almost all its residents would be affected by it, especially so, if it is the main water source of the community. Bacterias and other microbes thrive in dirty and stagnant water, which if consumed by human beings or animals, could lead to serious sickness or in some cases, death. Therefore, access to clean water is one of the most important resource a community needs for it to survive. 


Sure, I can help you with that. Here are the problems in the student essay and how they can be corrected to make a better paragraph:

* The sentence "Undoubtedly, water is the source of life for human beings, we drink and use it in the daily preparation of food" is redundant. The word "undoubtedly" means "without doubt," so the phrase "we drink and use it in the daily preparation of food" is already implied.
* The sentence "Consequently, if the water source in a community is contaminated, almost all its residents would be affected by it, especially so, if it is the main water source of the community" is a run-on sentence. It can be corrected by splitting it into two sentences:
    * "Consequently, if the water source in a community is contaminated, almost all its residents would be affected by it."
    * "This is especially true if the water source is the main water source of the community."
* The sentence "Bacterias and other microbes thrive in dirty and stagnant water, which if consumed by human beings or animals, could lead to serious sickness or in some cases, death" is a bit wordy. It can be simplified to:
    * "Bacteria and other microbes that thrive in dirty and stagnant water can cause serious sickness or death in humans and animals."

Here is the rewritten paragraph with the corrected problems:

**A community with access to clean water would experience fewer disease outbreaks.** Water is essential for human life, and we use it for drinking, cooking, and cleaning. If the water source in a community is contaminated, it can make people sick. Bacteria and other microbes thrive in dirty and stagnant water, and they can cause serious illnesses such as diarrhea, cholera, and typhoid fever. In some cases, contaminated water can even be fatal. Therefore, access to clean water is one of the most important resources a community needs to survive.

I hope this helps!---
