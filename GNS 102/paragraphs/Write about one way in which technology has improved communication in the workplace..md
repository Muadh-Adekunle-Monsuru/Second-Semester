Furthermore, workers are now able to receive feedback from customers faster and more efficiently. Technology has improved the workplace by allowing real-time communication. 


Sure, here are the problems in the student essay and how they can be corrected to make a better paragraph:

* **Problem:** The sentence "Employees are now opportuned to communicate directly with colleagues and customers alike" is a bit awkward. It would be better to say "Employees can now communicate directly with colleagues and customers."
* **Problem:** The sentence "Without moving a muscle, people across the world can be reached and talked to as if they are physically present with each other" is a bit redundant. It would be better to say "People across the world can now be reached and talked to in real time, as if they were physically present with each other."
* **Problem:** The sentence "For instance, employers and executives can communicate with employees, discussing confidential information, without any one of them being able to see one another" is a bit unclear. It would be better to say "For example, employers and executives can now communicate with employees privately, without having to worry about anyone else overhearing their conversation."
* **Problem:** The sentence "Furthermore, workers are now able to receive feedback from customers faster and more efficiently" is a bit vague. It would be better to say "Real-time communication has also made it easier for workers to receive feedback from customers, which can help them improve their performance."

Here is the rewritten paragraph with the better version:

**Real-time communication is one of the most valuable assets that technology provides to the modern workplace.** Employees can now communicate directly with colleagues and customers around the world, as if they were physically present with each other. This allows for more efficient and effective communication, as well as the ability to share confidential information more securely. Additionally, real-time communication can help workers receive feedback from customers faster and more easily, which can help them improve their performance.

Overall, real-time communication is a powerful tool that can help businesses improve their communication and collaboration. By taking advantage of this technology, businesses can stay ahead of the competition and provide better service to their customers.
