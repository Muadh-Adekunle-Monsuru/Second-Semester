Though assumption is the lowest level of knowledge; It is still a form of knowledge, and knowledge is key. Assumptions are the foundation upon which interpretations and conclusion are built. Everything I life operates under certain assumptions.

We make management decisions based on the assumptions we hold about how management ought to function and how people ought to be governed. For others, it is unconsciously but potent all the same. Our assumptions will either drown us or help us soar through life.

We have always seen life as an immense mansion with many rooms. Some roots lead to wealth others to the opposite. Ultimately, we decide where was end up; and life, thus far, has proved that every one of us decides well. We all behave differently where we have different levels of understanding, and behave the same way where our understanding is the same. We eat because we all understand the consequences of not eating. We all wear clothes because each of us comprehends lunacy. The list goes on and on. It is inevitable that some of us will make choices that get and keep us on the lover rung of the ladder by reason of exposure, training or some other variables. Life is about roleplaying. We choose our roles wisely or foolishly, consciously or unconsciously. Some of us get wiser to new levels of self-awareness enough to redefine our roles. Others make no effort to build further capacity and therefore remain where they are.

It is based on these realities that we draw the conclusion that not everyone will be wealthy in life. We lead, inspire and motivate people to strive and succeed. It is also important that we paint the full and true picture of life so that we an discourage vain pursuits. Balance must be enthroned as a critical component of truth, and people know, for instance that ‘top ‘is not a place that all must ascent.

Our greatest consolation lies in our deep conviction that true prosperity is in fulfilment through hard work that in intangible acquisitions. There are set roles that some of us have been wired up to paying life but which we are not content enough to pay because society esteems such roles to be inferior. Take the almost sacred office of a teacher for instance, there are people who have the natural gifts and _inclinations to be school teachers._ but the teaching profession, as it is, does not appear to be lucrative. So we have people who would have been fulfilled and effective working as school teachers serving in banks.
