1. What are header files in C and what are they used for
They are also called processor directives. Header files contains a set of predefined standard library function that is used to extent the functionality of a c program.
2. Explain what each of these header files are used for in C
	1. <math.h>: It is a header file that contains functions that are used to perform mathematical operations, sqrt(), sine())
	2. <string.h>: Used to perform various functionalities related to string manipulation. strlen(), strcmp()
	3. <conio.h>: Used by some compilers to provide console input/output
	4. <stdio.h>: Used to perform input and output operations. scanf(), printf()
 
 3. Explain what each of the following commands is used for in C programming. Give one example of its correct usage
 1. scanf(): Allows all types of user inputs to be collected and assigned to a declared variable. 
  >[!Example]
		  scanf("%d",&number); //this assigns the value the user inputs to the variable 'number'
	
 2. printf(): Allows strings/characters to be displayed to the standard output:
  >[!Example]
		 printf("Hello World!"); //outputs Hello World! to the standard output
   
 3. getchar(): collects a single character entered by the user and assigns it to a varible. 
  >[!Example]
		  digit = getchar(); // assigns the character input the the variable digit
   
4. puts(): performs the same function as printf. Prints out assigned value to the standard output. 
  >[!Example]
		  puts("Hello world!"); // prints Hello World! to the standard output. 
   
5. for(j=0;j<=5;j++): For loop, it iterates over a code block till a specified condition is met.
  >[!Example]
		  for(j=0;j<=5;j++){printf("%d\n",j);}//prints out 0,1,2,3,4,5 

4. Write a declarative command for each of the following
1. Three floating-point variable x, y, xz
```C
	float x;
	float y;
	float xz;
```
2. Two integer variables discounted amount, discount
```C
int discounted_amount;
int discount;

```

3. A constant floating point value Ï€ = 3.142
```C
	#define pi  3.142
	or
	float pi = 3.142;
```
4. Two strings, each of fifty five characters, called address1 and permanent address
	```C
	char address1[50];
	char permanent_address[50];
```
5. A double precision variable $P = 9.82354334* 10^{-9}$ 
```C
	double P = 9.8235e-9;
	printf("The value of P is %lf\n", P);
```

4. Give a skeletal description of the structure of a C program and explain its various components
```C
	A C program is made up of the 
	- Declarative Section: Where the variables and consants to be used in the code are declared
	- Executable Section: where the main code that performs the operation lives. 
	- Termination Section: Ending our code. 
   
int main(){
	// Start of  Declarative section
		int x;
		float y;
	 // End of Declarative section

	// start of executable  section
		sum = x + y;
	//  End of   executable  Section


	//start of termination section
		return 0;
}

```
