- One of the oldest programming languages in existence.
- It is very active and versatile
- C came into existence in 1972
- The syntax and the semantics of the language have similarities with Python


```C
#include <stdio.h> // Called header files, which ends with .h
int main(){
	Declarative Section;


	Executable Section;



}

End;
```

Data Type | Syntax 
----|----
Integer | int x;
Floating point | float x;  or Double x; //Double is more than 10 values
Character & String | Char x; or Char[35]

write a c program that contains only declarative statements for 
3 interger, character and floating point variables
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
int x,y,z;
char char1,char2,char3;
float float1,float2,float3;


return 0;
}
```
### Comments in C

```C
By using /*   this is a comment*/
or using //This is a comment
or /* this
		is 
				a
					multi line
								comment*/


```
