Sure! Here are the solutions to the questions I provided:

Premise: All students who study diligently pass the exam.
Premise: Some students fail the exam.
Conclusion: Therefore, some students do not study diligently.

Solution:
To prove the conclusion, we can use a proof by contradiction:
Assume the opposite of the conclusion: All students study diligently.
Based on premise 1, all students who study diligently pass the exam.
But premise 2 states that some students fail the exam, which contradicts our assumption.
Therefore, the conclusion is true: Some students do not study diligently.

Premise: All birds have wings.
Premise: Some penguins cannot fly.
Conclusion: Therefore, some creatures with wings cannot fly.

Solution:
To prove the conclusion, we can use a direct proof:
From premise 1, all birds have wings.
From premise 2, some penguins cannot fly.
Since penguins are birds and some penguins cannot fly, it follows that some creatures with wings (penguins) cannot fly.
Therefore, the conclusion is true: Some creatures with wings cannot fly.

Premise: All mathematicians are logical thinkers.
Premise: Some philosophers are not mathematicians.
Conclusion: Therefore, some logical thinkers are not philosophers.

Solution:
To prove the conclusion, we can use a direct proof:
From premise 1, all mathematicians are logical thinkers.
From premise 2, some philosophers are not mathematicians.
Since logical thinkers include mathematicians and some philosophers are not mathematicians, it follows that some logical thinkers (mathematicians) are not philosophers.
Therefore, the conclusion is true: Some logical thinkers are not philosophers.

Premise: All roses are flowers.
Premise: Some flowers are red.
Conclusion: Therefore, some red things are roses.

Solution:
To prove the conclusion, we can use a direct proof:
From premise 1, all roses are flowers.
From premise 2, some flowers are red.
Since some flowers are red and all roses are flowers, it follows that some red things are roses.
Therefore, the conclusion is true: Some red things are roses.

Premise: All cats have tails.
Premise: Some animals have no tails.
Conclusion: Therefore, some animals are not cats.

Solution:
To prove the conclusion, we can use a direct proof:
From premise 1, all cats have tails.
From premise 2, some animals have no tails.
Since some animals have no tails and all cats have tails, it follows that some animals are not cats.
Therefore, the conclusion is true: Some animals are not cats.

Premise: All politicians make promises.
PPremise: Some politicians are dishonest.
Conclusion: Therefore, some dishonest individuals make promises.

Solution:
To prove the conclusion, we can use a direct proof:
From premise 1, all politicians make promises.
From premise 2, some politicians are dishonest.
Since some politicians are dishonest and all politicians make promises, it follows that some dishonest individuals make promises.
Therefore, the conclusion is true: Some dishonest individuals make promises.

Remember, these solutions demonstrate the logical reasoning and application of rules of inference to establish the given conclusions.
