Types of Relations 
Page 44
- Reflexive: For any relation R on a set a A R is reflexive if and only if
$\text{a R a} ∀ \text{ a} \in R$
	Therefore For set $A = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}$
	Their must exist ${(1,1),(3,3),(5,5),(7,7),(9,9)}$ for A to be reflexive
- Irreflexive: $aRa$ does not exist for every member of A

- Symmetric: Let R be a relation on a set A, R i is symmetric if and only if $\text{a R b implies b R a }  ∀  \text{ a,b} \in A$
	Therefore For set $A = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}$
	 if there exists $(1,2)$ then their must exist $(2,1)$
 
- Asymmetric: if we have $aRb$ but not $bRa$ in the relation then it is not symmetric;

- Antisymmetric: Let R be a relation on a set A, then R is antisymmetric if and only if $\text{aRb and bRa implies a = b for ∀ a,b} \in A$ Does not apply to all a 

- Transitive: Let R be a relation on a set A, then R is transitive if and only if $\text{aRb and bRc →  aRc ∀}  \text{ a,b,c} \in A$ 
- therefor 

- Non-transitive
