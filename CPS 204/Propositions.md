### Logic
The foundations of logic mimic our intuitions by down 

Axiomatic concepts in mathematics:
- Equals
- Opposite
- Truth and Falsehood
- Statement
- Objects
- Collections


### Types of propositions:
- **Atomic Propositions;** It is made up of singe statements
- **Compound Propositions**; It is made up of two or more atomic proposition using logical connectives or logical operators 

A propositions is a statement that is true or false but cannot be both. 

Propositional Logic is a static discipline of statement which lack semantic content. 
			e.g p = "Clinton was the president"
					q = " The list of U.S. presidents includes Clinton"
					r = "Lions like to sleep"
				All p and q are no more closely relate than q and r are, in propositional calculus. They are both equally related as all three statments are true. Semantically, however, p and q are the same!
	


Logic is used to establish the validity of arguments

### Logical Connectives;
Operator | Symbol | Usage 
-|-|-
Negation | ¬ | not 
Conjunction | ∧ | and  
Disjunction | V | or 
Exclusive OR | ⊕  | xor 
Conditional | -> | if then 
Biconditional | <-> | If and only if iff 

#### Negation
All students are intelligent, it is an atomic proposition since there is no connectives. 
Its negation is ==Not all students are intelligent. ==

P |  ¬P
-|-
T | F
F | T

---

### Conjunction
Two preposition can be combined using conjunctions. 

But is AND
p and q will be true **only** when p and q are true

p: The lecturer is in class 
q: The students are in the hostel

P | Q | P∧Q
--|--|--
T| T | T
T | F | F
F | T | F
F | F | F
The lecturer is in the class and the student are in the hostel.
The lecturer is in the class but the student are in the hostel.

Whereas can be used as a conjuction, also however, although.

### Disjunction/OR
Applicants for the post of computer programmer must be over twenty years or Have at least three years relevant experience

p:  Must be over twenty years
q: Have three years relevant experience


V - **inclusive disjunction**: is true when at least one of the components is true

P | Q | P V Q
-|-|-
T| T | T 
T | F | T 
F | T | T
F | F | F

⊻ - **exclusive disjunction:** which is the same as **xor** they have the same truth table

P | Q | P ⊻   Q
-|-|-
T| T | F 
T | F | T 
F | T | T
F | F | F

---

### Conditional

It is partly akin to the English usage of "if, then" or "implies"

P | Q | P -> Q
-|-|-
T| T | T 
T | F | F 
F | T | T
F | F | T
There are many ways to express the conditional statement 
p -> q : If p then q. p implies q. If p, q. p only if q. p is sufficient for q. 

Some of the ways reverse the order of p and q but have the same connotation: q if p. q whenever p. q is necessary for p. 

p: I eat breakfast
q: I dont eat lunch

p -> q = If I eat breakfast then  I dont eat lunch. | I eat breakfast ==only if== I dont eat lunch. | whenever I eat breakfast I dont eat lunch. | That I eat breakfast implies that I dont eat lunch   

---
### Bi-Conditional 

For p <-> q to be true, p and q must both have the same truth value. Else, p <-> q is false. 

P | Q | P <-> Q
-|-|-
T| T | T
T | F | F
F | T | F
F | F | T

If and only if I eat breakfast then I dont eat lunch
I eat break breakfast if and only if I dont eat lunch

 The truth value is the truth(T) or falsity (F) of a proposition.
 A truth table is a table that summarizes the truth value of a proposition.
