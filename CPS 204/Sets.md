A set is a collection of different objects, those objects are the element or members of the set, membership is an instance of a set. There is no restriction on the number of elements in a set. A set can be finite or infinite, it can also contain no elements. 
Sets can be rearranged. 

One usually uses capital letters,$A, B, X, Y, . . .$ , to denote sets, and lowercase letters, $a, b, x, y, . . .$ to denote elements of sets.

Membership in a set is denoted as follows:
$a, b âˆˆ S$ denotes that $a$ and $b$ belong to a set $S$
$a\in S$ means $a$ belongs to a set $S$
$a \notin \text{S means a is not a member of S}$
Examples illustrating two ways or declaring the sets are:
$A = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}$
$B = \{x | x is an even integer, x > 0\}$

Three  dots symbolizes continuation
$A = \{1, 3,..., 7, 9\}$
$A_n = \{1, 2,3... n\}$ 

Sets can also be empty:
$A = \{ \} = \phi$
$B = \{\phi\}$
$\text{A and B are not the same. A is empty while B contains an empty se}t$

$A = \{x: P(x)\} \text{means x is a member of A that satisfies P(x) For all x P(x) must be true}$ 
$B = \{n:n=2 \text{m m is an integer and m is a greater than 0}\}$
