## Modus Ponens:

Rule: If you have a conditional statement "If P, then Q" and you know that P is true, you can infer that Q is true.
> [!Example]
Statement 1: If it is raining, then the ground is wet.
Statement 2: It is raining.
Inference: Therefore, the ground is wet.

## Modus Tollens:

Rule: If you have a conditional statement "If P, then Q" and you know that Q is false, you can infer that P is false.
>[!Example]
Statement 1: If it is raining, then the ground is wet.
Statement 2: The ground is not wet.
Inference: Therefore, it is not raining.

## Disjunctive Syllogism:

Rule: If you have a disjunction "P or Q" and you know that one of the options is false, you can infer that the other option must be true.
> [!Example]
Statement 1: It is either sunny or rainy.
Statement 2: It is not rainy.
Inference: Therefore, it must be sunny.

## Conjunction:

Rule: If you have two statements P and Q, you can form a conjunction "P and Q" by asserting that both statements are true.
> [!Example]
Statement 1: The sky is blue.
Statement 2: The grass is green.
Inference: Therefore, the sky is blue and the grass is green.

## Addition:

Rule: If you have a statement P, you can add any statement Q to form a disjunction "P or Q".
> [!Example]
Statement: It is sunny.
Inference: Therefore, it is either sunny or rainy.

## Simplification:

Rule: If you have a conjunction "P and Q", you can infer either statement P or statement Q.
> [!Example]
Statement: The car is red and it is fast.
Inference 1: Therefore, the car is red.
Inference 2: Therefore, the car is fast.

Sure. Simplification is a rule of inference that allows us to remove one of the conjuncts from a conjunction. For example, if we are given the statement "It is raining and the sun is shining," we can use simplification to conclude that "It is raining."

The rule of simplification is written as follows:

```
P ∧ Q ⊢ P
```

This means that if we are given the statement P ∧ Q, we can conclude that P.

In the example above, we are given the statement "It is raining and the sun is shining." This can be written as P ∧ Q. Using the rule of simplification, we can conclude that P, which is "It is raining."

Here is another example:

```
I am a student and I am a good person.
```

This statement can be written as P ∧ Q, where P is "I am a student" and Q is "I am a good person." Using the rule of simplification, we can conclude that P, which is "I am a student."

Simplification is a useful rule of inference because it allows us to reduce the complexity of our arguments. In the examples above, we were able to simplify the arguments by removing one of the conjuncts. This made the arguments easier to understand and evaluate.

## Hypothetical Syllogism:

Rule: If you have two conditional statements "If P, then Q" and "If Q, then R", you can infer "If P, then R".

> [!Example]
> Statement  1: If it is raining, then the ground is wet.
> Statement 2: If the ground is wet, then the grass is green.
> Inference: Therefore, if it is raining, then the grass is green.

Test the validity Of the argument:
• If it snows. Paul will miss class.
• Paul did not miss class.
• Therefore. it did not snow,
