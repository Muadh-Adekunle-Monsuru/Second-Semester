A tautology is a compound proposition which is true no matter what the **truth** values of its simple component. $t$
show that p v pbar is a tautology

p | ¬ p| p v ¬ p
--|-- | --
T | F | T
F | T | T

A contradiction, is a compound proposition which is false no matter what the truth values of its simple component.$f$
p | ¬ p | p ∧  ¬ p
--|-- | --
T | F | F
F | T | F

### Logical Equivalence  and Logical Implication

two propositions are said to be logically equivalent if they have identical truth values for every set of truth values of their components

Note that if two compound proportions are logically equivalent, then the compound proposition formed by joining them using the bi-conditional connective may be a tautology. 

Using capital P meaning it is not an atomic proposition
 P ≡ Q implies  P <-> Q
P <-> Q also implies P ≡ Q 
Contingency is neither tautology nor contradiction.

example
	1. If Friday is Eid then if I get paid I will buy chicken.
	p = Friday is Eid
	q = I get paid
	r = I will buy chicken

	p -> ( q -> r) 

2. If Friday is Eid and I get paid then I will buy chicken. 
	p = Friday is Eid
	q = I get paid
	r = I will buy chicken
 
	(p ∧ q) -> r
 
p -> (q->r) | (p ∧ q) -> r | P = Q

 A proposition P is said to logically imply proposition Q if, whenever P is true Q is also true 
 Note the converse is not true
  P ⊢ Q 
	does not mean Q ⊢ P
 For logical implication Q is never false when P is true

Given p -> q
	- the converse is q -> p
	- Inersere: ¬ p -> ¬ q
	- Contrapositive: ¬ q -> ¬ p
