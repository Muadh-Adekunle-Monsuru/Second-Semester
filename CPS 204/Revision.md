What is the relevance of Discrete Structures to Computer Science studies?

Discrete structures are used to model many real world problems
Discrete structures provides students with a foundation in the mathematical concepts that are essential in computer science
It helps to develop critical thinking and problem solving skill that are needed to be successful in the field.

1. $\exists x(x \text{ is a rose} \land \neg(x \text{ is red}))$ this statement means that there exists something x such that x is a rose and x is not red.
	$\forall x(x \text{ is a rose} \rightarrow \neg(x \text{ is red}))$ This statement means that for all things x, if x is a rose, then x is not red.
2. $\forall x(x \text{ is a person} \rightarrow \neg(x \text{ is perfect}))$ This statement means that for all things x, if x is a person, then x is not perfect.
	$\neg\exists x(x \text{ is a person} \land x \text{ is perfect})$ This statement means that there does not exist anything x such that x is a person and x is perfect
3. $\exists x(x \text{ is a FUO student} \land x \text{ is a genius})$ This statement means that there exists at least one student who is both a FUO student and a genius.

1. Yes, p = I don't drink, q = I drive
2. p -> q
3. If i drink, then I dont drive
notP -> notq
They are not equivalent

## Definitions from Past Questions
Using a suitable example describe the following terms:
1. **Proposition:**  A propositions is a statement that is true or false but cannot be both. 
2. **Truth value:** Truth value is the property of a proposition that indicates whether it is true or false.
3. **Tautology:** A tautology is a compound proposition which is true no matter what the **truth** values of its simple component.
4. **Contradiction:** A contradiction, is a compound proposition which is false no matter what the truth values of its simple component.
5. **Argument:** An argument in logic are propositions which consists of premises and conclusion 
6. **Contingency**: Contingency is neither tautology nor contradiction.


3. a) ∀x(Human(x) → Equal(x)) This can be read as "for all x, if x is a human, then x is equal."
4. ∃x(Student(x) ∧ ¬GoodEssayWriter(x)) This can be read as "there exists an x such that x is a student and x is not a good essay writer." In other words, this statement asserts that there is at least one student who is not a good essay writer.
5. ∃x(UniversityEducation(x) ∧ Poverty(x)) This can be read as "there exists an x such that x has a university education and x is poor."
